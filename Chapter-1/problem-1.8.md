**What is the multiplicative inverse of 5 in Z11, Z12, and Z13?**
- The multiplicative inverse of 5 in Z11 is **9**.
- The multiplicative inverse of 5 in Z12 is **non-existing**. 
- The multiplicative inverse of 5 in Z13 is **8**.

 With this simple problem, we want now to stress the fact that the inverse of an integer in a given ring depends completely on the ring considered. That is, if the modulus changes, the inverse changes. Hence, it doesnâ€™t make sense to talk about an inverse of an element unless it is clear what the modulus is. This fact is crucial for the RSA cryptosystem, which is introduced in Chap. 7. The extended Euclidean algorithm, which can be used for computing inverses efficiently, is introduced in Sect. 6.3
