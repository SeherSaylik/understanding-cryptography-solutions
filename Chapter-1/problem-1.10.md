**1.10. Find all integers n between 0 ≤ n < m that are relatively prime to m for m = 4, 5, 9, 26. We denote the number of integers n which fulfill the condition by φ(m), e.g. φ(3) = 2. This function is called “Euler’s phi function”. What is φ(m) for m = 4, 5 ,9 ,26 ?**

1. For m=4: The integers less than 4 are 0, 1, 2, and 3. Out of these, 1 and 3 are relatively prime to 4. Therefore, ϕ(4)=2.
2. For m=5: The integers less than 5 are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. Out of these, 1, 2, 3, and 4 are relatively prime to 5. Therefore, ϕ(5)=4.
3. For m=9: The integers less than 9 are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Out of these, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8 are relatively prime to 9. Therefore, ϕ(9)=6.
4. For m=26: The integers less than 26 are 0, 1, 2, ..., 24, 25. Out of these, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, and 25 are relatively prime to 26. Therefore, ϕ(26)=12.
So, with the additional information provided, the values of ϕ(m) for m=4,5,9,26 are 2,4,6,122,4,6,12, respectively.
