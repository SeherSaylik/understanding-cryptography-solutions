**1. 1/5 mod 13**

   To calculate it, we need to find the modular inverse of 5 modulo 13. The modular inverse is calculated as followed;
(5â‹…x) mod 13 = 1
Here x, so the answer we're looking for, needs to be '8' as 5.8 mod 13 = 1. 

**2. 1/5 mod 7** 

   5.x mod 7 = 1, x=3

**3. 3.2/5 mod 7**

   (5/6).x mod 7 = 1, x=4
