The affine cipher is a type of monoalphabetic substitution cipher, where each letter in an alphabet is mapped to its numeric equivalent, encrypted using a simple mathematical function, and converted back to a letter.

In the given problem, the key parameters are a=7 and b=22. The alphabet size is typically 26 for English letters.

To decrypt, we use the inverse function D(x)=a^(−1).(x−b) mod m, where a−1 is the modular multiplicative inverse of a modulo m.

First, find the modular multiplicative inverse of a=7 modulo m=26. The modular multiplicative inverse exists only if a and m are coprime (i.e., they have no common factors other than 1).

In this case, a=7 and m=26 are coprime, and the modular multiplicative inverse of 7 modulo 26 is 15 (because 7×15≡1mod  267×15≡1mod26).

Now, decrypt each letter in the given text using the inverse function:
